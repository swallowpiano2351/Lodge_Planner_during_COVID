1. DESCRIPTION
Travelers are spending tremendous amount of time on researching the spread of COVID-19, the location, safety and price of lodging for their destinations. This project is an improved Airbnb lodging planner which provides integrated information combining COVID cases, crime activity, population density and so on. Through this tool, trailers are able to make solid decisions for their traveling in the upcoming holiday season.

In this package, you will find a report and a poster in the DOC folder, stating the development process and outcome of this project. All the code for the front end execution and the back end model are put in the CODE folder.

2. INSTALLATION
No extra installation is required for running this tool.

3. EXECUTION
We highly recommend that you use Firefox 80.0 to run this tool. You may also need to setup a local HTTP server in the root folder depending on your web browser. We recommend to use http:server for Python 3. 

To run the server:
Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the directory you want to have the root directory.
Execute the command to start the server.
Python 3 â€” python -m http.server 8000

Please make sure the html file, all the csv files, and the lib folder which contains the necessary libraries, are put together in the root folder.
